# Masson-Pine-101.6K-probe
Welcome to the Masson-Pine-101.6K-probe GitHub repository! Provided here are the design SNPs information for the 101.6k liquid-phased probe. 

113709SNP.xlsx: Brief information on probe design SNPs.

SNPIDchange.xlsx: The large size of the Masson Pine genome, with some single chromosomes exceeding 2 GB in length, poses a challenge to existing software analysis tools. Therefore we cut the first five chromosomes, and the cutting information and SNP information before and after cutting are shown in the table.

pinus_massoniana_113K_seq.fa: Corresponding Probe Targeting Capture Sequence of 113KSNP.

Disease resistance phenotype data.xlsx：Phenotypic data for a large number of Masson Pines subjected to PWN inoculation experiments.

Disease resistance genotyping data.vcf：The data is so large that it is difficult to upload （RAW: 18T, after filter: 18GB）, and those who need it can contact the below article author.

The probe set is freely available for all to use with no restrictions with an aim to be collaborative and update the probe set as new information is discovered. As new studies are published and if new Masson Pine markers are designed, researchers can contribute these additional markers by forking and creating a new branch from this repository and we will merge them together upon further review.

The application of the above DATA can be found in the article below. Also please cite the following paper when using the probe set:
Under Review
